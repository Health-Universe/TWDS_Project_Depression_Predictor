# TWDS_Project_Depression_Predictor
A lightweight application to predict the risk stratification of depressive mood disorder based on USA CDC BRFSS 2020 data. This application should never be positioned as a diagnostic tool, it's just for quick screening. Please consult medical departments if any concern. Thanks.

# Future work
1. Support Traditional Chinese version.

5. To any specific user, the application could analyze the main factor (question) causing the high risk score.
6. Improve the UI/UX inferface.
